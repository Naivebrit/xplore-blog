                        <h2>Working on Track Layout</h2>
                        <p>Nick, Dan, Adam, and Celeste reviewed the coaster track layouts and ironed out some of the details. Decisions were made about how the coaster is going to move on the track as well as the type of material that the track is going to be made out of. 3-D printed prototypes were made to assist in the visual conceptualization of the track. The height and length of the roller coaster is to be determined, but the constraints from how the product will be shipped give a better picture of how the coaster will come together. </p>

                        <h2>Preparing for the Webinar</h2>
                        <p>Today our group came together with one goal in mind, to create the frame. We acquired 2x4 dimensional wood from our local Menards along with some screws and got to work. After updating our design several times we were able to come up with one the we thought was feasible for the Zoom! Coaster. As Sunday's are busy for our group due to our other activities, we had people rotating duties to make sure we got a lot of work done today. Along with building we worked on Coding and our electrical equipment as well. All areas of expertise of our project and coaster moved forward today in a great direction.</p>

                        <h2>Frame Design</h2>
                        <p>After discussing with our advisors we came up with a better alternative to the frame. We decided to make it out of 80-20 metal stock for extra support and make it look more appealing. This will be a decision in the long run as it will make our lives a lot easier when storing, presenting, and shipping our final project. The design of the frame will still look very similar to the wooden one we initially made.</p>

                        <h2>Frame Complete</h2>
                        <p>We created the entire frame using the cut pieces of 80-20 we acquired to create a frame that suits the needs of our project. It dimensions fit the requirements for shipping and can still fit the rollercoaster track and PLC we need it to. We also used sheet aluminum for the base. The middle piece of sheet aluminum was cut with a sheet metal shear to make it the exact dimensions we need it to be.</p>

                        <h2>Building the track pt 1</h2>
                        <p>Today, we spent a lot of time fastening the acrylic pieces of track together. The goal is to be able to bend them using heat. This will create the loops, turns, and corkscrews needed for our track. Meanwhile, we have began to understand the necessary elements needed for programming.</p>

                        <h2>Building the track pt 2</h2>
                        <p>The first hills of the track were created today and work really well with the roller coaster car we have. We have attached aluminum stock supports in order to keep the track in place. This helps the track stay put postionionally and keep the correct orientation.</p>

                        <h2>Machining the cart</h2>
                        <p>One of the ideas we had for our cart was to have it be made of aluminum so the extra weight would have it go down the track even faster. This would minimize the loss of energy as the cart would go down the track. However, we discovered that it is extremely difficult to properly machine the cart if it is made of metal. So we stuck with 3d printing PLA for our cart.</p>

                        <h2>Building the track pt 3</h2>
                        <p>More and more of the track was built including a loop. We made the loop the biggest dimension it could be while the cart could go around it. After bending the acrylic into the desired shape the loop functioned very well. It retained enough energy for the cart to continue around the track.</p>

                        <h2>Troubleshooting the cart</h2>
                        <p>Another issue with the cart was discovered. It tended to get stuck on parts of the track and could not go around a corkscrew piece almost at all. We quickly found a way to remedy the problem by making the cart into two smaller pieces connected by a wire. We later tested a ball & socket mechanism only to find it did not work well either. The solution that we came up with that works the best was connecting the pieces with pneumatic tubing. This made the cart go around not only the loop super well but the corkscrew piece as well.</p>

                        <h2>Electronics!</h2>
                        <p>Another shipment of our PLC and HMI parts came in today. After waiting for what felt like a long time we were able to begin the implementation process of the automation side of our project. Another one of our faculty advisors helped us understand the HMIâ€™s and help us begin to start working with the electrical slides.</p>

                        <h2>Elevator assembly</h2>
                        <p>In order to make the cart go around the coaster in the way it does, two automated elevators are needed. This will restore the potential energy of the cart and will make sure it can make one complete loop around the entire track while showing even more automation.</p>
